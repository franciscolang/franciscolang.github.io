Hello.

I am a Research Fellow in Atmospheric Science at Monash University in Australia. I received my Ph.D. in Atmospheric Sciences at Monash University studying boundary layer structure over the Southern Ocean. 

In my country Chile, I studied and graduated from Renewable Natural Resources Engineering at Universidad de Chile in 2010. I was awarded with a Becas Chile scholarship to start my doctorate studies in 2014.
